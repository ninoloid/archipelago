### How to Run Locally
To run locally, you have to run the backend
```bash
cd backend
npm i
npm run dev
```

Then, you have 2 options of the frontend
1. By running vue-based frontend
    ```bash
    cd vue-frontend
    npm i
    npm run dev
    ```

2. By running simple html frontend (for testing purpose)
    ```bash
    cd simple-html-frontend
    ```
    then open the index.html
